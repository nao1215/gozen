# Installs Ubuntu packages on a GitHub-hosted runner without waiting on a slow
# mirror (docs/development/ci.md). Usage: scripts/ci_apt_install.sh PACKAGE...
#
# The Azure mirror the runners prefer can keep transferring at a very low speed
# without timing out; one graphics shard spent 508 seconds on a step its sibling
# finished in 21. So this script prefers the official Ubuntu HTTPS archive
# (keeping the runner's other mirrors as fallbacks), lets apt retry a failed or
# stalled connection, and bounds the two network phases, the index update and
# the download, with a deadline. A phase that passes its deadline is started
# again, up to three attempts; apt resumes the partial downloads. The packages
# are unpacked only after every file is on disk, so the deadline never
# interrupts dpkg. Run it before any other step that uses apt, so that step
# reads the same mirror order.
